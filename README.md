This is my fork of David Callahan's code for my **"Make your own programming language in Python" tutorial series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD)**

This code is an interpreter for a BASIC-like language written in Python 3.

Will like to make some improvements to the code

Would like to acknowledge [angelcaru](https://github.com/angelcaru/myopl-plus-plus) who has made many improvements
